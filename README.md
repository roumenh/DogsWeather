# DogsWeather (Psí počasí)
app by Roman Hruska

This was a weather app project that transformed over time to a Birthday present for my mum. It works quite like any weather app, showing weather of places. But on top of it, for each kind of weather (rain, clear sky, snow...) there is a dedicated photo of my dog Robin. Each time you discover new kind of weather, the image is revealed as a card in gallery.
